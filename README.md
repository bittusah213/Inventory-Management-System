# Inventory-Management-System

## Project Objective

### The **Inventory Management System Dashboard** in Excel is a comprehensive tool designed to track and manage product flow efficiently across various business operations. It is divided into several functional sheets: **Purchase**, **Dashboard**, **Inventory**, **Sales**, **Products**, and **New Entry**, each serving a specific purpose.
## Purchase
### The **Purchase** sheet records all incoming stock from suppliers, including purchase date, supplier name, product details, quantity, and cost. This helps maintain a log of all procurement activities.
## Dashboard
### The **Dashboard** provides a visual overview of the entire system. It includes key metrics such as total stock, low inventory alerts, top-selling products, and monthly sales/purchase trends using charts and pivot tables. It is the central monitoring point for business performance.
## Inventory
### The **Inventory** sheet dynamically updates based on purchase and sales data, showing current stock levels of each product. Conditional formatting may be used to highlight low-stock items, ensuring timely restocking.
## Sales
### The **Sales** sheet captures all outgoing inventory detailsâ€”product sold, quantity, date, customer, and sale price. This data is critical for revenue tracking and inventory deduction.
## products
### The **Products** sheet serves as a master list of all items the business deals with, including product codes, categories, unit prices, and stock thresholds. It feeds other sheets through data validation and lookups.
## New Entery
### The **New Entry** form allows for quick data entry of sales or purchases using dropdowns and simple forms, reducing manual error and improving efficiency.

### Together, these interconnected sheets provide a powerful, easy-to-use inventory system in Excel, ideal for small to medium-sized businesses looking to streamline operations without expensive software.
